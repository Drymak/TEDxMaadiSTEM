                <h4 class="writer">Mohamed Abohatab</h4>
                    <p>If we took a deep look at the stories of the most successful people in all the eras, we would definitely sort out many things in common. Although every successful person has his own story with its second to none plot, there are some steps that they all have taken to get to the right track.<br><br> They all had a mindset of commitment, persistence and the stamina to go the long distance. Unfortunately, many people see from a limited lens; they see the single success ignoring the many failures. Certainly, many people know Elon Musk, but a few know about his journey from the bottom to the top. In 2008, Elon Musk had to take a lifesaving decision, a decision that was considered as a milestone in Musk’s life. He had a relatively small amount of budget and he had two companies at the brink of bankruptcy. Logically, it was expected if he put all the money in one company, the other will collapse and if he split the money, both companies will collapse. So, he managed to take the risk and split all what he had got for the sake of the companies’ rebirth. He had that powerful robust mindset that kept energizing his soul with positivity and diminishing his fear with the power of hope. He visualized himself succeeding, so he simply succeeded. It is all about the mindset you have. His company SpaceX failed in launching a space rocket for three times in a row and that went viral. Back then, he was interviewed, and the interviewer said to him “That third failure in a row, did you think to pack this in?” his short yet powerful answer was enough to reflect who he would be today, a role model for millions of people. He answered “Never. I don’t ever give up.”<br><br> 
                    What would you do when your life heroes, role models, cast stones in your direction and when they testify against your idea and criticize it? That was what Musk endured when his heroes, Neal Armstrong and Gene Cernan, testified against commercial space by SpaceX. That was hard on Musk, too hard, in fact, that his eyes were full of tears, but he managed to pass through it, accept their opinions and astonish them with his deeds. Musk proved that limits really exist only in the mind and as commonly said “It always seems impossible until it’s done”. Now, Elon Musk is the CEO of the first private space company to send an aircraft to the space and he is also the CEO of the world number one electric cars manufacturing company, Tesla.<br><br>3 
                    To conclude, the stronger your mindset is, the more significant you will affect the world and achieve what has been thought to be unachievable. With the right mindset and ambition, you can practically achieve anything. Elon Musk is only one of many robust demonstrations of the unlimited powers of a right mindset. He fought through his life against all hatred to come up on top. So, what are you waiting for?! Set your mindset in the right way and prepare to endure challenges to succeed!

                    <p>There is no doubt that Nelson Mandela was one of the most inspiring influential icons in human being history. Affected by his community standards at his time, he spent his life defending freedom and race equality<span id="dots4">...</span><span id="read-more-target4">The first black president of South Africa has suffered and faced numerous difficulties, obstacles, and injustice until he became the most venerable leader in the history of South Africa.
                      Rolihlahla Mandela was born in the village of Mvezo in South Africa on July 18, 1918. His father was a principal counselor of the Thembu tribe. Rolihlahla attended primary school in Qunu, being the first member of his family to enter school, where his teacher gave him the name “Nelson”. Unfortunately, Rolihlahla’s father died when he was 12, leaving his son facing life difficulties alone.
                      In 1939, Nelson started his university education in Fort Hare university then Witwatersrand university where he studied law. During his university years, Mandela and his black mates were exposed to racism and apartheid from their teachers and even the principle. For instance, the principle has dismissed Mandela one time for 2 weeks as a punishment for him.
                      Mandela joined the African National Congress in 1944 as a step in the resistance against the ruling National Party’s apartheid policies. Mandela was arrested in 1962 and condemned to five years’ imprisonment with hard labor. Unfortunately, On June 12, 1964, Mandela was sentenced to life imprisonment at Robben Island Prison, where he combatted Tuberculosis.
                      After 27 years of imprisonment, Mandela finally was released. All these tragedies that he faced throughout his life did not affect his ambition towards the cause he fought for, they just made him stronger. Thus, he became the first black president of South Africa in 1994. In addition to being the president of the African National Congress and establishing the Nelson Mandela Foundation for children, he won the honored Nobel peace prize. He was the first one to give black people in South Africa the right for voting. In fact, Mandela settled the constitutions of the Republic of South Africa.
                      Nelson Mandela is a role model who fought for his cause and his people as he was their symbol of patience and diligence. He did not only conquer for his cause; he also changed the way that the world looks for black people. Mandela proved that success and urbanization only depend on hard work, a person’s mind, good planning, effort exerted, and creativity, not on people’s race or skin color. Mandela left an imprint that will still engraved in our minds, and we all should learn from.

                    <h4 class="article2-3-title">"Tony Robbins: from nothingness to everything"</h4>
                    <p>Have you ever heard about a poor-born man who couldn’t go to college because of its expensive cost and worked as a janitor but later become one of the richest men on Earth? Yes, he is Tony Robbins who inspired<span id="dots5">...</span><span id="read-more-target5">millions of people with his enchanting words and distinctive voice. Tony Robbins is the world's premiere "performance coach," a job that entails selling out stadiums with life coaching seminars and serving as a sort of leadership consultant to clients like billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff. It's also a career path he carved out for himself.
                      Tony Robbins was born and grown up in California in 1960. He was the eldest of three children and his parents divorced when he was 7. His mother married more than once, and she was addicted to drugs and alcohol and was physically abusive. He attended Glendora High School. He was elected student body president in his senior year. While growing up, Robbins worked as a handyman to help provide for his siblings. One day his family was in total poverty and had no money to buy food. The house was full of screams and suddenly, there was a miracle. Someone knocked on the door and when tony opened, he found a box full of food. That moment touched him deep and he promised himself that he would help people one day the same way his family was helped. When he was seventeen years old, he left home and never returned but he still helped his family with the money he earned from his small jobs. Robbins later worked as a janitor and did not attend college. At that time, he faced many problems as he didn’t find a house and didn’t have much money to rent or buy one. But, he never gave up, as he believed as he said, “Every problem is a gift; without problems, we would not grow.”
                        These problems were a gift that changed his life as that time he decided to go pave his path in education. In his adolescence, he read nearly 100 books a year. He was reading in psychology and philosophy. One day, everything changed. Robbins heard from a friend about a famous motivational speaker who was hiring called Jim Rohn. So, he found it as the perfect opportunity to email the speaker.  Soon his request was accepted, and Robbins began to work and learn from him. Through the experience from Jim, Robbins began to give his own seminars to motivate people, from prices ranging from 35$ to 5000$. But Robbins didn’t stop here, he continued to grow and develop until he was a featured speaker at the 2007 Technology, Entertainment and Design (TED) conference. Two years later, the huge success of his first book 'Unlimited Power' launched him into the mainstream. Robbins has coached some of the world's most high-profile people, including Oprah Winfrey, Andre Agassi, Bill Clinton, Paul Tudor Jones, Serena Williams, Leonardo DiCaprio, Nelson Mandela, Princess Diana, and Mother Teresa. Tony Robbins is currently the most respected motivational speaker in the world. He's also quietly built an empire as he has now more than 33 companies. The Anthony Robbins Company isn't just limited to his speaking engagements; it's a diversified group of businesses in industries such as hospitality, education, media production, and business services. Despite his never-ending fame and wealth, he never forgot the promise he made in his young days; He donated to more than 50 million people around the world to feed them.
                      In conclusion, despite all the conditions and challenges you face in your face, you should never succumb to them. Robbins is just a great example among many of people who never gave up in their path although the path wasn’t ideal.
